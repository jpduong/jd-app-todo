# Coding challenge

## Your task

You have been asked to develop a to-do list application that allows the user to create and manage tasks. The application has the following features:

- Add and view tasks
- Delete a task
- Complete a task
- Set a priority for my tasks
- View the tasks sorted by priority and name
- View the number of total and completed tasks

## Instructions

Please provide relevant source code of your implementation and any documentation and additional assumptions that you feel are appropriate. Please use the following information to assist you with completing the challenge successfully:

- The intent of the challenge is to provide us with an opportunity to judge your problem solving, design and development skills. It is important to provide a solution that highlights your skills in these areas.
- Develop the system using the latest web technologies.
- Server side code is not required.
- Your solution should be high quality, well annotated, and include tests.
- The simplest solution is often the best

## Documentation

Used a free resource as a UI guide, https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW. Files I referenced can be found in /designs folder. Used this as a base template, and expanded on the design on to suit the requested features.

## Assumptions

- Assumed that after "adding" a task, you are able to edit it still
- Assumed the sorting functionality can be done by multiple fields

## Notes worth mention

- Intentionally has initial data to help demo the app

## Running project locally

```
git clone https://github.com/jpduong/jd-app-todo.git
cd jd-app-todo
npm i
npm start
npm test (for running tests)
```
